## Functionality:

* there is initially an empty web page
* when the user clicks on the screen a popup box appears
* the box allows the user to search google for, and select an image
* the image is then inserted into the webpage at the location of the click


## Improvements ideas

* put small cross-mark on clicked place
* have top-fixed options panel with 'show / hide image borders', and border styling
* arrange popup as a separate html with associated javascript (like Web Component), and get it imported

## Ideas

* put small cross-mark on clicked place
* open a floating popup
* find & select image
* insert `<img/>` instead of cross-mark - use absolute positioning ?
* have top-fixed options panel with 'show / hide image borders', and some others ?
* option: **download** image firstly, then embed it from localhost ?

## The task is to:

* create initially an empty web page
* when the user clicks on the screen a popup box appears
* the box allows allows the user to search google for, and select an image
* the image is then inserted into the webpage at the location of the click

We are interested in your architecture, and code design/organisation, and approach. Choose any language you like.
 
Bonus points for not using any external packages to get the images. 

Its fine to make and document any assumptions you need to in order to complete the task. 
When you are done please send us the link to the GitHub project where it resides.
